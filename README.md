# Modelling Airbnb's property listing dataset
- Building a framework that systematically trains, tunes, and evaluates models on several tasks that are tackled by the Airbnb team.

# AiCore
- This is the 4th project in my AiCore journey.

# What I learned
- Clean the data using advanced pandas operations
- Clean image data using PIL library
- Generate a series of hyperparameters to tune for regression, classification, and neural network models.
- Train and validate regression and classification models using sci-kit learn (sklearn)
- Train and validate neural networks using PyTorch
- Evaluate models using different scoring parameters
- Iterate through the trained models metrics files and find the best trained model
- Visualise the loss function on Tensorboard
